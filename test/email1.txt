Dear Sir,

PRML quiz was the first exam we have taken among all the other courses here at IIT Madras. We were not really sure about what kind of questions to expect either.

I have received a lot of requests from my classmates to request you to increase the number of quizzes to 6 and make it best 4 out of 6. I have raised this issue in the CR meeting and they have told me to ask you.

We would be really grateful if you could consider it.

Thanks and regards
